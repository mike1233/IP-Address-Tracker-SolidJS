## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind/Postcss
- SolidJS / Typescript [url](https://www.solidjs.com/guides/getting-started#try-solid)
- Zod [url](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- Axios [url](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

### What I learned

During this project I learned to setup my first SolidJS project and got a basic grasp on how to work with the reactivity system. I also got to try out Zod to set up schema's/types for my application.

### Continued development

I want to dive deeper into the workings of Zod specifically to see if i can improve my current and future applications in terms of runtime typechecking/validations of the data.
